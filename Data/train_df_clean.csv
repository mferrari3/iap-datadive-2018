The project is financed from a $45 million grant under ADB’s $570 million Energy Sector Development Investment Program.""Lack of access to reliable power supply constrains economic development, poverty alleviation, and inclusive growth in the country,"" said ADB Country Director for Afghanistan Mr. Samuel Tumiwa. ""We are proud that we can contribute to the expansion of the power distribution network and help provide more electricity for households, businesses, health centers, and schools in the southwest of Kabul and, hopefully, make their lives better.""The demand for power is rapidly growing across Afghanistan. Despite significant progress since 2002, only about 32% of the population has access to grid-connected electricity, which increases the cost of doing business and is detrimental to the environment. Over the coming years, ADB will support the increase in the country’s electrification rate from 30% to 83% and lift the share of domestic generation from 20% to 67% by 2030. ADB will also play a major role in power transmission both regionally and domestically, and promote clean energy, including through solar power.ADB is Afghanistan’s largest development partner in the energy sector with cumulative grant assistance of nearly $2.2 billion, all of which is on budget with the government. ADB has helped deliver electricity to more than 5 million people in Afghanistan. ADB has been working not only to develop power imports for urgently needed electricity, but also to provide distribution systems, develop domestic generation, build capacity and promote institutional reforms, and develop a large renewable program that will include off-grid options.ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Established in 1966, it is owned by 67 members—48 from the region. In 2017, ADB operations totaled $32.2 billion, including $11.9 billion in cofinancing.","['helps', 'network', 'development', 'electricity', 'southwest', 'inaugurate', 'provide', 'afghanistan', 'million', 'distribution', 'adb', 'energy', 'power', 'mr', 'kabul']",ADB Helps Inaugurate New Power Distribution Network in Southwest Kabul,"The MFF will reinforce ongoing projects and finance new investments to boost energy trade and regional cooperation, strengthen the country's energy infrastructure, increase energy supply to accelerate electrification rate, and improve operational efficiency in the sector. In power, generation (renewable energy), transmission (regional and domestic lines), and distribution (on- and off-grid networks) projects are proposed; while wells rehabilitation is planned in gas.The impact of the MFF will be improved access to sustainable energy supplies across Afghanistan.

4,d1d79dd8,ADB-50312-003,1,"MANILA, PHILIPPINES (21 February 2018) — The Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved loans totaling $360 million to buy modern rolling stock and support reform in Bangladesh Railway to help promote a shift from roads to rail.“Railways in Bangladesh potentially offer a cheaper, safer, and more fuel-efficient means of transport of goods and passengers than roads, but have been held back by lack of investment and aging and unreliable rolling stock,” said Tsuneyuki Sakai, an ADB Senior Transport Specialist. “The ADB Railway Rolling Stock Operations Improvement Project will boost the operational performance of Bangladesh Railway by introducing new technology, equipment, and processes that will be cleaner and more efficient, cutting carbon dioxide emissions.”Historically, railways enjoyed a monopoly as a carrier and transported most commodities. However, its market share has dropped because of inadequate investment in railway infrastructure and rolling stock over an extended period. This has resulted in unreliable freight operations and uncomfortable experiences for passengers. Most rolling stock is more than 30 years old, and much is past the end of its economic life. Maintenance facilities have also not improved over time and are not adequately equipped.Under its Seventh Five-Year Plan for fiscal years 2016-2020, the government has placed special emphasis on railway development, setting targets to increase the market share to 15% in freight transport and 10% in passenger movements by 2020.Bangladesh Railway has also been operating at a loss, its operating costs about double what it makes from revenue. Under the railway reform supported by ADB, the government has taken steps to boost revenue by raising the level of passenger and freight tariffs that have remained unchanged for decades. An increase in the operational capacity through new rolling stock is needed to generate more revenue.Starting with a Railway Sector Improvement Program in 2006, ADB has provided four loans to the government for railway development totaling $2.81 billion. Three loans invested in network improvement in key sections of the railway, with two targeting enhanced South Asian subregional connectivity. The Railway Reform Project under the 2006 program introduced financial reforms and an enterprise resource planning information technology (IT) system. A loan approved in 2015 is also procuring rolling stock and maintenance equipment, for which work is ongoing to 2020.This latest project seeks to address the investment and modernization needs of Bangladesh Railway. It will procure 40 broad gauge locomotives, 125 luggage vans, and 1,000 wagons for freight trains for use on major lines of the rail network. The rolling stock will introduce auxiliary power units (APU) to Bangladesh Railway, to significantly reduce diesel consumption when the locomotives are idling. The project will also draw up investment plans for urgently required maintenance facilities, establish training programs for the drivers, and run the enterprise-wide IT system.The total cost of the project is $453.37 million, of which $93.37 will be met by the government. It is due for completion around the end of June 2022.Accompanying the loans is a technical assistance grant of $500,000 to devise a training scheme for drivers in the use of the APU and recommend potential approaches to achieving overall energy efficiency. ADB will administer the grant, to be provided by the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, established by the Government of Japan.ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.

The drop in the market share of the railway as a carrier is the result of the long-term underinvestment in railway infrastructure and operational improvement of Bangladesh Railway. Recognizing the virtues of the railway as a cheaper, safer and fuel-efficient transportation mode, the government places special emphasis on railway development and set targets to increase railway market share through prioritized investment in railway infrastructure, focusing on network capacity improvement, operational capacity improvement and railway reform implementation. The project aims at improving the operational capacity and efficiency of Bangladesh Railway.

It has since metamorphosed into the SCO, which now includes Uzbekistan, India and Pakistan.“The world needs a recommitment to multilateralism, and we need it now,” Ms. Mohammed stressed.“Regional and international threats to security and stability, from transnational crime to climate change to violent extremism and terrorism, cannot be resolved by any one country alone,” she added.The deputy UN chief called the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SCO’s Development Strategy 2025 “our blueprints for joint action.”She flagged last year’s SCO joint communique as underscoring the 2030 Agenda’s implementation and as an important step toward strengthening cooperation in mutual sectors.“Your joint commitment to support the promotion of innovative technology; to sharing experiences in the formulation and implementation of national development strategies, as well as to working together towards the creation of a favourable investment and business climate are crucial and we are here to support you in those endeavours,” Ms. Mohammed said.“To ensure a fair globalization, we must ensure nations are able to have the necessary domestic resources and capacities to steer their economies and development agendas towards our common goals as outlined by the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement,” she added.The Deputy Secretary-General commended the bloc’s commitment to counter regional threats and its revitalization of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group as a strong contribution to support the Afghan-led peace process.Turning to cross-border cooperation, she hailed China’s Belt and Road initiative as “promoting connectivity, economic prosperity and diplomatic ties across the region.”“The UN continues to support stronger collaboration between developing countries by catalyzing, brokering and facilitating South-South cooperation across many spheres,” she asserted.Ms. Mohammed noted that UN-SCO relations, based on the 2010 Joint Declaration, “provide a solid foundation for future cooperation to benefit of people of this region and the world.”“Let us take every opportunity, starting with the first-ever UN Conference of Heads of Counter-Terrorism Agencies later this month, to build and strengthen our partnership and cooperation at the global, regional and local level,” she said.","['asean', 'bgrimm', 'region', 'development', 'support', 'deputy', 'renewable', 'cooperation', 'sco', 'mohammed', 'joint', 'adb', 'energy', 'power', 'secretarygeneral', 'ms', 'expand']","ADB, B.Grimm Power Expand Support for Renewable Energy in ASEAN",ADB's equity investment and corporate loan facilities will be used to partially fund the financing requirements for the expansion of B.Grimm Power Public Company Limited (_B.Grimm_ or the _Company_)'s energy business in the ASEAN region,ASEAN Distributed Power Project: Initial Poverty and Social Analysis

The agreement was signed by Shane Rosental, ADB Country Director and Andrew Mkrtchyan, Chairman of the Ameriabank Board of Directors, at a ceremony in Yerevan.“We are very pleased to be investing in Ameriabank. In partnership with Ameriabank’s dynamic team, we will help provide more credit to small and medium-sized enterprises so they can help contribute to the growth and development of Armenia,” said Mr. Rosental.The vital role of Ameriabank in the development of the Armenian economy and the local banking system, its solid performance results over the last ten years, in addition to its increasingly active role in the well-being of society were the key drivers in the realization of this sizable undertaking. Ameriabank is a leader in the banking system by all main financial indicators. The Bank is the largest lender in the country with assets at the end of 1Q 2018 being USD 1.4 billion.“We highly appreciate this new level of partnership which is a clear reflection of the level of confidence entrusted by ADB towards Ameriabank. This endeavor will create a renewed momentum for the Bank to achieving its strategic goals and long term aspirations, and will accelerate its efforts towards accessing global capital markets in the foreseeable future.I am confident that our joint efforts will promote the development of the Armenian banking sector, and will contribute to the economic growth in our country in general, and to the progress of SMEs in particular”, commented Andrew Mkrtchyan, Chairman of the Board of Directors at Ameriabank.Access to finance in Armenia remains a challenge, especially for SMEs and microentrepreneurs, despite their overall significance to Armenia’s economy. SMEs account for the vast majority of enterprises in the country but contribute a disproportionately low amount to gross domestic product (43%) and employment (41.7%).Strengthening the banking sector in Armenia will help improve the availability of credit to SMEs and expand private financial services in the country, while increasing the financing capacity of AMB to serve SMEs. Specifically, the project will enable AMB to provide sustainable financial services to SMEs so they can create more jobs and contribute to the growth and diversification of Armenia’s economy.As part of its financing package, ADB also expects to provide a technical assistance grant to AMB to support digital banking, IT systems, and risk management investments.ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Established in 1966, it is owned by 67 members—48 from the region.Ameriabank is a dynamically developing bank and one of the major and most stable financial institutions in Armenia. The first investment bank in Armenia, Ameriabank has been providing a large package of innovative banking services since 2007. Now Ameriabank CJSC is a universal bank offering corporate, investment and retail banking services in a comprehensive package of banking solutions. -0-12:04 07.05.2018","['inclusion', 'growth', 'financial', 'services', 'smes', 'banking', 'promote', 'country', 'equity', 'ameriabank', 'armenia', 'adb', 'loan', 'help', 'bank']","ADB loan, equity to Ameriabank to help promote financial inclusion in Armenia",,

15,86d7fa70,nan,0,"ZIMBORDERS, a locally-owned company, has been awarded a US$100 million contract to rehabilitate the Beitbridge Border Post within 100 days, as President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government targets to improve efficiency at the country’s busiest port of entry.Staff WriterThe project was caught up in the massive Zanu PF factional fights during former president Robert Mugabe’s era with Mnangagwa’s faction and the G40 faction which had coalesced around former first lady Grace Mugabe having vested interests.While the Mnangagwa faction preferred Zimborders to carry out the project, the G40 faction preferred a South African company linked to controversial businessman Nikko Shefer. However, senior government officials told Zimbabwe Independent that Transport minister Joram Gumbo in December directed Zimborders to commence the project and complete it within 100 days.“The Beitbridge rehabilitation will be done because Zimborders has been notified to commence operations,” a government official said.“Zimborders won the tender in 2016 but cabinet then stopped the company from proceeding with its project.”During his 2018 budget presentation, Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa said the Beitbridge Border Post will be re-ordered.“Government acknowledges the need to ease entry and exit of tourists and travellers, improve trade facilitation and revenue collection efficiency at Beitbridge Port of Entry,” Chinamasa said.“In the longer term, this will also require large investment in new infrastructure facilities at the port of entry. In the interim, government has been working with the African Development Bank to improve exit and entry efficiencies using the existing facilities.“In this regard, the border post expert subsequently engaged, with the assistance of funding from the African Development Bank, has since concluded the final report to this effect.”Chinamasa also said government was implementing short-term measures, which include “full rollout of the Electronic Cargo Tracking System, connection of electronic manifest control system to the ASYCUDA World Server, harmonisation of Container Depot operations to 24 hours in line with the border post’s operating hours, connection of mobile scanners to ASYCUDA World Server in order to enable real time entry and timely acquittal of goods.”According to Chinamasa, government will also prioritise the relocation of passenger buses carrying commercial cargo to a transit shed for purposes of clearance.“This assists to provide convenience to travellers with nothing to declare, implementation of the e-customs initiative for the advance clearance and online payment of relevant charges for tourist motor vehicles.”In 2015, Chinamasa said Zimbabwe needed US$100 million for construction and repair of the border to enable it to meet international standards.Transport Ministry officials told the Independent the rehabilitation work will also include the construction of a new bridge, rehabilitation of the weighbridge and upgrading of communication and security systems. The project also includes the upgrading of the road network to and from the bridge, installing gate control infrastructure and erecting a perimeter fence around the post. Other facilities to be upgraded include the parking areas, commercial centre and staff accommodation.The border post will also be computerised and have its lighting systems upgraded. Systems which will enable the implementation of measures to strengthen collaboration between the South African Revenue Service and the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) through the harmonisation of customs systems and procedures at the border post, will also be installed at the border.Beitbridge Border Post is one of the busiest inland ports in sub-Saharan Africa and links the northern and southern corridors with a record 500 vehicles and 10 000 travellers passing through the port daily.However, the port lacks soft and hard infrastructure that includes information technology and inspection bays, among others, to deal with high volumes of traffic have resulted in a lot of inconvenience to travellers.Travellers spend between six and 18 hours at the port of entry to complete immigration and customs formalities.The clearance of commercial traffic can take up to three days. The border is one of the most porous in the entire region, something which has made Zimbabwe’s counterpart in South Africa uneasy.","['post', 'rehabilitation', 'border', 'zimborders', 'entry', 'chinamasa', 'us100m', 'systems', 'project', 'faction', 'beitbridge', 'port']",US$100m for Beitbridge border rehabilitation,,

17,82edb610,nan,0,"Harare BureauTHE African Development Bank (AfDB) has extended a three-and-a-half-year $25 million loan facility to the local private sector that will be administered through CABS.The facility is expected to help small to medium private players improve on their working capital, address liquidity constraints, cover the growing gap in foreign currency needs as well as import the much needed raw materials.Speaking at the signing ceremony in Harare yesterday which was also attended by Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Governor Dr John Mangudya, AfDB Country Manager Damoni Kitabire noted Zimbabwe’s potential to recover from its economic past, given the framework that is being laid by the “new political and institutional dispensation.”He said local industry has been affected by business confidence which has been low over the last two decades during which the sector has grappled with numerous challenges including lack of working capital, liquidity constraints, inadequate foreign currency for manufacturing companies and the continued influx of cheap imported products. “The agreement for signature for a Trade Finance Line of credit worthy $25 million with a tenure of 3,5 years is a testament to the African Development Bank’s strong commitment to Zimbabwe,” said Mr Kitabire.“It marks the beginning of a new relationship not only between the African Development Bank and CABS, but also one that we believe will potentially extend to the broader commercial banking sector in the country.“In a nutshell, this facility will be used to provide medium term foreign currency liquidity specifically for trade finance purposes.“The AfDB is aware of the fact that Zimbabwean financial institutions are struggling to secure trade finance lines from the international market, especially those with tenure in excess of 270 days.“The facility, therefore, partly mitigates this challenge by allowing CABS to on lend over a longer tenure especially in sectors where longer term trade finance funding is required, such as agriculture, infrastructure and manufacturing,” he said.AfDB, Mr Kitabire said, hopes the intervention will complement Government’s current efforts which seek to revitalise the economy by among other interventions, improving access to affordable credit for small to medium enterprises while supporting the country’s economic transformation.He said the bank’s expectation is to achieve a multiplier effect whereby increased employment will stimulate demand and further enhance private sector development. CABS managing director Simon Hammond thanked AfDB for choosing Zimbabwe and channelling the fund through CABS.“This facility will no doubt go a long way in supporting our local industry including manufacturing and exporting companies as a whole.“These companies will in turn generate foreign currency and this will obviously contribute to the economic revival of Zimbabwe, something, I am sure we all want dearly.Mr Hammond noted that due to the economic challenges that the country had been facing, long-term deposits were becoming thin as the banking sector had to contend with just short term and transitory deposits.He also assured AfDB that, like in the past with funds from other international investors, CABS will make sure the fund performs well and be settled as and when it falls due.","['25m', 'sector', 'development', 'foreign', 'finance', 'extends', 'loan', 'economic', 'zimbabwe', 'afdb', 'currency', 'private', 'trade', 'facility']",AfDB extends $25m loan facility to private sector,,

It is in this vein that the alternative crossing at Volivo and the by-pass road is vital,” the minister explained.The detailed designs for the bridges and its implementation plans have all been duly completed, and are now awaiting an allocation of funds for the road component before actual commencement of works.The Japanese firm JICA, which is undertaking the bridge project, is also committed to the signed agreement with Ghana to develop the Asutuare Junction to Asikuma road concurrently with the bridge.","['development', 'construct', 'adomi', 'amoakoatta', 'alternative', 'volivo', 'link', 'cash', 'afdb', 'govt', 'secured', 'project', 'road', 'secures', 'bridge', 'volta', 'facilitate']","Gov't secures $20m AfDB cash to construct link road, facilitate 2nd 'Adomi Bridge'",,

We have started to see (the results) already in how the debt levels are (declining), how growth is coming back and how unemployment is coming down,” he said.Moreno said while this is the result of the sacrifice of the Jamaican people, “it really began (when successive Administrations) decided that it was time to take the bull by the horns”.The seventh annual Caribbean Governors' Meeting was hosted by the Bank of Jamaica under the theme 'Jump Caribbean'.It focused on helping the region to embrace the digital revolution as a developmental tool.The IDB has indicated that it wants to improve the capacity of the region to tap into technology and apply innovative methods as a means to solve problems, improve productivity, generate employment and advance development.","['initiatives', 'key', 'jamaica', 'us248m', 'public', 'transformation', 'million', 'provides', 'govt', 'idb', 'national', 'nids', 'think', 'security', 'technology']",IDB provides US$248m for key gov't initiatives,,

Its analysis also found that the rise in alternative and marketplace lending options in the market has not yet made a significant impact on SMBs’ ability to access trade finance products.The Trade Finance Program collaborates with more than 200 partner banks to provide guarantees and loans for trade finance. According to the FIs, the program has facilitated more than $30 billion in trade finance to SMBs across Asia since its launch in 2009.“As one of the world’s leading global trade banks, Citi is pleased to support this initiative to help fund trade flows with multinationals as well as SMEs in and out of developing markets,” added Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions Global Trade Head John Ahearn in another statement. “By introducing this new product and continuing our collaborating with ADB, we look forward to furthering our mission of enabling growth and economic progress.”While Citi retreated its payments processing operations from the Asian market in 2016, the FI has since increased its corporate banking operations across Asia-Pacific with a particular focus on trade finance.","['ink', 'program', 'financial', 'trade', '100m', 'smbs', 'deal', 'citi', 'asian', 'global', 'adb', 'finance', 'transactions']",Citi Inks $100 Million Trade Finance Deal With Asian Development Bank,,

Muhith, and other senior officials during a 3-day visit in which he committed to further strengthen ADB’s 45-year partnership with the country.In his discussions, Mr. Nakao acknowledged Bangladesh’s impressive economic and social development over the last decade. The growth in these 10 years averaged about 6.3% and reached 7.3% in 2017. This high economic growth has enabled Bangladesh to attain middle-income status in July 2015 and helped cut poverty from about 49% in 2000 to 24% in 2016.Mr. Nakao noted that Bangladesh is on track to continue its growth momentum and complimented the government for sound management of the economy. “Accelerating GDP growth through higher investment in manufacturing and key infrastructure is the right strategy,” he said. “Sustaining this progress, however, will require an improved investment climate for the private sector, better revenue mobilization, and continued prudent macroeconomic management.”The ADB President also commended Bangladesh’s handling of the humanitarian emergency that has seen an influx into its borders of over 688,000 people from Myanmar since October 2017. Mr. Nakao reiterated ADB’s offer of support to help the government address the crisis, if requested.ADB’s Country Partnership Strategy for Bangladesh proposes total assistance of $8 billion, including for nonsovereign operations, during the period 2016-2020, 60% up from $5 billion in 2011-2015. In 2016-2017 ADB approved $2.5 billion in sovereign and $600 million in nonsovereign assistance. To support government efforts, ADB will provide additional resources depending upon need, performance of ongoing projects, and readiness of new projects.“ADB remains committed to supporting infrastructure development in the energy, transport, and urban sectors to help Bangladesh promote private investment, attract foreign direct investment, and boost growth further,” said Mr. Nakao.He added that ADB would also continue to invest in primary and secondary education along with technical and vocational training to help the vast young population better prepare for quality jobs. One important priority is to provide science and technology education especially for female students.In the urban sector, ADB’s investments are supporting water supply, sanitation, urban roads, and municipal governance for service delivery in cities such as Dhaka and Khulna, as well as many secondary towns.In his meeting, Mr. Nakao reiterated ADB’s support to the government to formulate a comprehensive plan for developing an economic corridor in the southwest region to diversify economic activities, ensure regionally balanced development, and open opportunities for enhanced regional cooperation and integration in South Asia and beyond.Mr. Nakao visited selected ADB-assisted projects in Bangladesh including the Ashuganj power plant, a secondary school in Bhairab, urban infrastructure improvement activities in Narsingdi, and railway improvements in the Dhaka-Chittagong corridor.Bangladesh joined ADB in 1973, and in 1982 became the first ADB member to host a field office.

Also, the reason of our meeting today would further contribute to accelerating the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD).”JICA Chief Representative in Côte d’Ivoire, Tsutomu Iimura, said his institution fully adheres to the African Development Bank’s High 5s.“There is no limit in the potential collaboration and synergies between the two institutions.”Iimura expressed the hope that JICA’s projects and contributions to ADF-14 would bolster the Bank’s capacity to carry out the objectives of the High 5s in countries where support is most needed.Co-signing the accord for the African Development Bank, Acting Vice-President for Finance, Hassatou N’Sele, thanked the Japanese Government and its people for “exceptional support” to the ADF-14 replenishment, noting that, “These investments by Japan will make a difference in the lives of many Africans. Japan is one of the African Development Bank’s most privileged partners. Your various financial instruments will help us meet our development goals”.The African Development Fund is part of the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group and provides support primarily to least developed and poor countries in the form of very long-term, low-interest financing. In contrast, the African Development Bank, which is the other arm of the African Development Bank Group, provides financing to middle-income countries in Africa.Since its inception in 1972, the African Development Fund has conventionally received subscriptions in the form of grants from donor countries, including Japan, as a source of funding to achieve its development mandate. During the negotiations of its fourteenth replenishment, the African Development Fund offered donor countries the opportunity to include concessional loans within subscriptions to the Fund for the very first time.JICA also provides private sector development support through projects under Enhanced Private Sector Assistance for Africa (EPSA), which the Government of Japan and the African Development Bank launched as a strategy for support in Africa in July 2005.It is JICA’s policy to maintain its relationship with the African Development Bank Group as an important development partner contributing to economic growth and poverty alleviation in Africa.","['replenishment', 'african', 'development', 'support', 'gives', 'countries', 'fund', 'loan', 'africa', 'bank', 'afdb', '700m', 'japan']",Japan Gives $700m Loan To AfDB,,
45,5eca9220,nan,0,"The African Development Bank (AfDB), Green Climate Fund (GCF), and the Africa50 investment fund are collaborating to bring solar energy to the Sahel, in support of the priority set by countries in the region.The three organisations said they would share ideas and resources about opportunities to make solar power available throughout the region, transforming African deserts into new sources of renewable energy.The Desert-to-Power scheme, initiated by the AfDB, aims to develop 10,000megawatts (Mw) of solar energy across the Sahel region. It is intended to provide solar generated electricity to 250 million people, including 90 million through off grid solutions, thereby enabling the development of agriculture and other economic activities.GCF Executive Director, Howard Bamsey, said: “Sahel countries have identified the potential of solar power to bring green energy to people across the region. Renewable energy investment is a priority in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.”Bamsey made the comments while signing a letter of intent detailing cooperation on the sidelines of the AfDB’s Annual Meetings, in the Republic of Korea’s coastal city of Busan.AfDB President Akinwumi Adesina welcomed GCF’s support to the initiative, which he said has the potential – with investment from the private sector – to become the world’s largest solar power zone.“The Desert-to-Power scheme will transform countries in the Sahel region by accelerating their access to energy through solar power. To realise this ambition, strong collaboration is needed. Therefore the partnership with the Green Climate Fund and Africa50 is a great milestone and will help us deliver at scale.”CEO of Africa50, Alain Ebobissé, said: “Africa50 is about leveraging partnerships to contribute to the continent’s growth through developing and funding high impact private and PPP infrastructure projects. This agreement allows us to leverage our project development capabilities and build a bigger pipeline of bankable projects that will provide millions of people and businesses on the continent with clean and affordable energy.”The AfDB is promoting sustainable economic development and social progress throughout its member African countries, thereby contributing to poverty reduction. It has established Africa50 as an investment vehicle to focus on high-impact national and regional projects, mostly in the energy and transport sectors.Africa50 is a new investment vehicle established by the AfDB, designed as an independent infrastructure fund that focuses on high-impact national and regional projects, mostly in the energy and transport sectors, with a particular emphasis on increasing the pipeline of investment-ready projects.","['region', 'development', 'africa50', 'deserttopower', 'partner', 'gcf', 'sahel', 'fund', 'solar', 'projects', 'afdb', 'power', 'energy', 'scheme', 'investment']","AfDB, GCF partner on 'Desert-to-Power' scheme",,

Pandian, AIIB’s chief investment officer, said.AIIB’s loans include a $200 million commitment to India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund to spend on roads, housing and urban development, and the bank will let the Indian government decide how to use that money.Energy-related projects will primarily be focused on renewables, Pandian said, without providing additional details.China-backed lenders are taking a more hands-off approach to overseas development financing, unlike western banks whose financing often comes with social and environmental strings and strengthens the voice of non-profits.AIIB wants to encourage the transition to renewable energy but is not against investments in coal-related projects, unlike most of its peers who have campaigned against further investments in coal.Any foreign investment in renewables is crucial for India, which needs at least $125 billion in investments to complete its ambitious target of adding 175 GW in clean energy by the end of 2022.Like this report?

65,53b2c218,AIIB-000021,1,"For years, Beijing has cast a shadow on a patch of swamp abutting Georgia’s Black Sea coast. Under former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, ambitious plans were drawn up to turn this marshland into a Chinese-inspired “instant city” – a large cluster of skyscrapers that would be home to half a million residents.But Lazika – Georgia’s ambitious city of the future – was abandoned. Today, the site is blanketed by a vast array of interlocking tetrapods. These bulking concrete behemoths will form a breakwater to protect berthing ships from incoming waves.This is the foundation for the Anaklia Black Sea Deep Water Port, Georgia's bid to become a key link in China's sprawling Belt and Road Initiative.By 2025, the developers estimate the port will be able to process 100 million tons of cargo per year and could generate an extra half percent for the country’s economic growth rate. Once finished, the port will be the country’s largest – dwarfing existing ports in the Black Sea cities of Poti and Batumi – with the added benefit of being able to receive even larger ships.Anaklia is 2km south of the de facto border with AbkhaziaThe choice of Anaklia as home to this new port also benefits Tbilisi: It lies just two kilometers south of the de facto border with Abkhazia, and is part of a strategy to strengthen the state's presence in the region.China appeared to suffer a setback in 2016, when the tender to construct the $2.5 billion port – initially expected to go to Chinese investors – was instead awarded to a group of Americans and Georgians, the Anaklia Development Consortium (ADC).Critically for Georgia, which faces an official unemployment of 12.5 percent, the ADC offered more favorable employment prospects than its Chinese rivals, with an estimated 6,400 jobs expected to be created for locals.But regardless who builds it, Georgia sees Anaklia as playing a key role in the Belt and Road, which has also been called the Silk Road Economic Belt, and the One Belt, One Road initiative (OBOR). “The decision was unexpected, but it’s only a minor disappointment from the perspective of the Chinese state,” said Joseph Larsen, an economic analyst at the Georgian Institute of Politics. “The port should become an important component of the Silk Road Economic Belt regardless of who builds it.”And even in development, China isn't getting totally shut out: In December, the ADC signed an agreement with Chinese firm ZPMC for $50 million toward the port’s construction.For the West, the South Caucasus offers an attractive alternative to other Belt and Road trade routes. Russia has poor infrastructure, an unpredictable regulatory environment, and is engaged in a trade war with the EU. Georgia is also more geopolitically palatable than Iran, which remains a pariah in the West and has poor relations with many of its neighbors. Tbilisi also ranks favorably in global indices measuring corruption and ease of doing business.Crucially, Georgia’s Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the EU – signed in 2014 and effective since 2016 – is easing the way for Georgia to serve as a logistics hub. China followed suit with a bilateral free trade agreement that came into effect on January 1. Under the agreement, Georgia will eliminate tariffs on 96.5 percent of Chinese exports, while almost 91 percent of China’s imports from Georgia will become tariff-free immediately.The Chinese government first announced its Belt and Road initiative in 2013, calling it the “project of the century” and pledging to invest $150 billion every year in related projects. Georgia became directly involved in 2016 when it joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), a $100 billion fund designed to finance Belt and Road projects. This year, Georgia signed an agreement under which the bank will provide $114 million to build the Batumi Bypass Road, a new highway to connect Georgia’s hinterland to the port city of Batumi through a series of mountain tunnels.“I think it would be great to have more competition between different transportation modalities and transport companies,” said Eric Livny, director of the International School of Economics at Tbilisi State University. “In the medium term, demand for transportation services between the Caspian and Black Sea could be sufficiently elastic to make everybody better off despite greater internal competition and lower prices.”But with China encouraging market competition between interchangeable corridors, the Anaklia port’s construction is no guarantee of its success. Indeed, elsewhere, some Chinese-funded Belt and Road projects have stalled amid concerns about economic feasibility and goals.Moreover, Georgian infrastructure remains underdeveloped, which could leave the port disconnected from the country’s network of free industrial zones (FIZs). To counteract this, Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili developed a so-called “Spatial Arrangement Plan” to improve the country’s roads.“By fixing all the roads we will build the backbone of Georgia that will connect all the regions. Then geographical location will not be a barrier for doing business or living there anymore,” said Kvirikashvili at the plan’s launch in 2016.The government seeks to build 550 kilometers of highway as well as repair 800 kilometers of roads. In addition, 300 new bridges and 50 new tunnels will also be built for an estimated $3.5 billion. All of this is aimed to better connect the new port at Anaklia with the country’s growing network of FIZs.The Anaklia port will also include a 600-hectare FIZ where companies from around the world will be able to produce goods and services for export, free from corporate and value-added taxes. Georgia already has set up similar zones around the country, attracting significant attention from Chinese investors.Chinese companies have bought the free industrial zone at Poti and the Kutaisi free industrial zone, “although it doesn’t actually make any of the goods being produced there,” Larsen, of the Georgian Institute of Politics, said. “So far, Chinese companies are mostly earning income by owning and operating the free industrial zones.”","['georgia', 'chinese', 'economic', 'road', 'free', 'port', 'seeks', 'belt', 'anaklia', 'countrys', 'georgias', 'place', 'project', 'chinas']","With Port Project, Georgia Seeks Place on China's Belt and Road","According to AIIB documents, this project will finance the construction of a new two-lane 14.3 km long highway to provide a bypass to the Batumi port city (second largest city in Georgia). The road will be constructed on a new alignment, which passes through a number of mountainous settlements. Due to hilly nature of the terrain, this stretch of road requires construction of 5 tunnels and 19 bridges over rivers and valleys. Additionally, the controlled-access highway will have 4 grade separated interchanges to regulate traffic ingress/egress.

The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has already granted its in-principle clearance to fund the drinking water scheme and it is expected to approve the final project cost after receiving the DPRs. Nandigama, Jaggaiahpet, Tiruvuru, Pedana and Vuyyur municipalities in Krishna district and Tadepalle, Mangalagiri, Vinukonda, Macherla and Piduguralla towns in Guntur district were selected for the scheme.According to initial estimates, every town would get at least Rs 20 crore for taking up the drinking water schemes.

It has a diversified and international – by local standards – investor base that includes Japan-based Sawada Holdings and the IFC, the private-sector arm of the World Bank. And it is both big and small.Big, in that it has more assets ($2.9 billion) than any of its domestic commercial banking rivals, an impressive digital banking presence, a solid priority banking service that it extends to mass-affluent customers and a growing army of corporate customers, ranging from mining giants to small and medium-sized firms.It reported returns on its equity and assets of, respectively, 17.5% and 1.99% in the third quarter of 2017, handily beating all of its top-tier peers. It is also regularly more profitable than them, and made a net profit of Tug101 billion ($41.4 million) through the first nine months of 2017, a year-on-year rise of 43%.But Khan Bank is also proud to be small, in that it focuses on the little guy and does it well. Khan has more retail customers – 2.4 million in a country of barely 3 million people – than any of its main rivals. It reaches them via a growing network of 537 branches and more than 1,000 ATMs.Khan Bank’s customers range from camel herders working alone in some of the harshest terrain on Earth to some of Mongolia’s largest companies. And it strives to treat them all equally.Best corporate and investment bank: Trade and Development Bank of MongoliaIt can be hard work being a corporate-focused lender in Mongolia. The last few years have been a slog for many banks as they confront a sluggish economy that often teeters on the edge of insolvency and that offers precious few new lending opportunities.But through it all, one lender has remained as unflustered and unflappable as ever, extending credit to and managing the various needs of Mongolia’s largest companies. Trade and Development Bank of Mongolia (TDB) is by far the best and biggest corporate banking player in the country, serving 400 big domestic firms, as well as 45% of all trade finance transactions.At the end of September 2017, it accounted for 46% of all outstanding domestic corporate loans, according to data from the Bank of Mongolia. It also accounted for more than a third of money market trades in the third quarter of 2017, and a little under 30% of foreign exchange trading.It is Mongolia’s most active lender internationally, thanks to direct correspondent relationships with more than 150 foreign lenders and financial institutions.TDB has worked hard in recent years to diversify its corporate lending portfolio, which is skewed toward big domestic industries, notably mining, construction, real estate and commodities.While the last few years have been hard going, growth is finally ticking again up in the wake of a recent IMF bailout and a renewed push to get the giant gold-and-copper Oyu Tolgoi mine up and running.Mongolia’s economy seems ready to shine again. No bank is likely to benefit more than TDB.Best bank for SMEs: XacBankMongolia’s push to develop a banking sector fit for the 21st century – a process that is being accelerated by a slew of financial reforms – is likely to benefit lenders with a diverse group of shareholders and better transparency and corporate governance.XacBank, whose chief investors include the IFC and the EBRD, is firmly on this list.With 1,300 staff working in 86 branches across the country, it is one of Mongolia’s largest and best-run lenders, with a burgeoning digital presence and an expanding priority-banking business.But it is in the small and medium-sized enterprise space that XacBank really comes into its own. It has spent the last few years searching for new ways to identify and target owners of SMEs, the lifeblood of the frontier economy.In June 2017, it signed a loan agreement with the IFC and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the development finance arm of the US government, to boost lending to SMEs owned by women and to offer female entrepreneurs better financial and business advisory services.The Bank of Mongolia estimates that two thirds of all SMEs in the country are owned by women.XacBank is also working with the Japan International Cooperation Agency to channel small business-development loans of between $10,000 and $40,000 to locally controlled SMEs that aim to turn a healthy profit while also striving to alleviate poverty, promote sustainable development and protect the environment.Best bank for CSR: Arig BankIt’s hard to miss Arig Bank’s commitment to corporate and social responsibility and to sustainability in general.Mongolia’s second-oldest commercial lender may not dominate the banking scene, and its headquarters on Chinggis Avenue, squeezed between a police station and a power plant, may be more humble and homespun than those of many of its peers, but it makes its mark in so many other ways.Arig is deeply involved in CSR-related projects, both big and small.At one end of the scale, it helps to recycle plastic – a scourge of the capital Ulan Bataar – by donating to a charity that crafts surprisingly comfortable sofas out of old drinks bottles.Every Saturday, it holds seminars at its headquarters that teach students as young as 12 important lessons about financial matters, ranging from basic household budgeting to how to start a pension fund.Tumurkhuu DavaakhuuEvery October it hosts a national financial literacy day; chief support officer Tumurkhuu Davaakhuu reckons the most recent event co-organised with the Mongolian Bankers Association was attended by 1,000 people of all ages.The bank is deeply involved in tackling the capital’s dreadful air quality, reducing litter and waste, and bringing clean drinking water to every part of the country.But two of its campaigns really stand out.First up, its work with New York-based Achilles International, which helps to instil in disabled people a sense of confidence by promoting sporting activities, notably an annual mass run that has drawn 39,000 participants over the last three years. And second, by donating, along with ING Group, wash blocks and locker rooms to new kindergartens based in local-style Ger tents.“We have 140,000 children who are not in pre-school education because of the lack of kindergartens,” says Davaakhuu. “Without these pre-schools, many working parents would leave their kids at home with the door locked, so for many of them, this programme is a genuine life saver.”Best private bank: Trade and Development Bank of MongoliaPrivate banking is a minority pursuit in a frontier market lacking a deep seam of wealthy customers. But it’s growing, with banks preferring in the main to focus on priority banking services that target the reasonably prosperous.Popular services include platinum and gold credit cards, asset protection and insurance, safe-deposit box services, gold trading and investment advice.Randolph KoppaKhan Bank offers an excellent suite of priority banking services, as do Arig Bank, XacBank and Golomt Bank.But this award goes to Trade and Development Bank of Mongolia. The country’s largest and best corporate lender also has the largest and best onshore priority banking service, controlling around 20% of the market.TDB was the first onshore lender to offer such services, way back in 2004. Its client roster has grown slowly but surely ever since, to around 300 people, each with personal assets of at least $200,000.TDB’s executive vice-chairman and president Randolph Koppa says it will remain focused on providing priority banking services to wealthy customers in just one city, the capital Ulaan Bataar, via two dedicated private banking offices.Mongolia is a small economy where wealth remains highly concentrated in the hands of a few individuals. But as its economy grows, the market’s population of mass-affluent customers will too – and that is when the competition will really heat up.Best digital bank: Khan BankMongolia is a fascinating case study in digital banking. A handful of years back, barely anyone in this frontier market went online to track and pay bills, transfer cash to friends, or pay for goods and services.All that has changed – and fast.Khan Bank chief executive John Bell reckons the share of total retail transactions carried out in-branch at the counter fell to 6% in December 2017, from 60% three years before.Lenders are falling over themselves to market their digital dynamism to customers; some, such as Trade and Development Bank of Mongolia, Arig Bank, and XacBank, offer a wealth of impressive online services.But Khan Bank’s vast retail network – no other lender reaches more people, from shepherds to office workers, in more nooks and crannies of this vast country – gives it a healthy head start over the competition.Khan Bank has grabbed its opportunity with both hands.It was the first onshore lender to roll out phone banking, an around-the-clock call centre and drive-through ATMs.It has more digital banking customers than anyone else. Its Qpay service allows customers to pay utility bills and taxes, make customs payments, open a new account and apply for a host of financial services, all via their smartphones.Fingerprint identification technology, now widespread across the country, allows customers to log in to their accounts instantly and more securely. And in 2017, the bank rolled out its Khan Pay service, which allows customers to send money to their friends online, via Facebook.","['mongolia', 'development', 'awards', 'services', 'trade', 'khan', 'corporate', 'lender', 'banking', 'customers', 'best', 'asiamoney', '2017', 'bank']",Asiamoney best bank awards 2017: Mongolia,"A senior loan to XacBank (""XB"") for up to USD 10 million under the Financial Intermediary Framework (""FIF"") for financing private micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (""MSME"") in Mongolia.

McDowell said this would not diminish the importance of the capacity already booked from Azerbaijan.The 870-km pipeline will join up with the Trans Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) at the Turkish border, crossing Greece, Albania and the Adriatic Sea. Its shareholders include Azerbaijan energy group Socar, oil major BP and Italian gas group Snam.McDowell said he hoped the EIB’s stamp of approval would smooth the way for the 4.5 billion euro ($5.57 billion) pipeline to seek further financing from the market in the coming weeks.TAP has said the final shipment of pipes were delivered in the autumn and are ready to lay.The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is also expecting to decide on a loan for TAP this year, a spokesman said. In October, it approved a $500 million loan for the TANAP pipeline, through which the first gas flows are expected in 2018.But TAP has been dogged by delays because of protests against it in Italy.Campaign groups have also questioned the wisdom of pumping more gas into the EU as the bloc seeks to increase the share of renewables in its energy mix.They have said that funding the Azeri-backed project would go against the EBRD and EIB’s principles.The EIB says it has listened to civil society groups and carried out due diligence on the project.","['billion', 'pipeline', 'gas', 'approves', 'mcdowell', 'europe', 'european', '15', 'euro', 'tap', 'loan', 'bring', 'project', 'eib']",EIB approves 1.5 billion euro loan to TAP gas pipeline,This project will finance the construction of a gas pipeline through Turkey for transportation of natural gas from Shah Deniz production field in Azerbaijan to European and Turkish markets.,TANAP TRANS-ANATOLIAN NATURAL GAS PIPELINE

So when we have good economic cooperation between the countries, the case is so strong that everything else, security issues and political issues get sidelined and you get good cooperation between these countries which will bring stability in the region,” he said.Meanwhile, officials from the power supplying company Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) have said that with the implementation of TAP project, people of certain areas lying on the TAP route will benefit from the electricity available through the project.TAP OverviewTAP 500 KV Power Project (Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan) is one of the most important regional energy projects. The memorandum of understanding for the project was signed in December 2015 between Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan.TAP is a 500-kV transmission line project which falls under the framework of Central Asia Regional Electricity Market (CASAREM). TAP and TAPI are separate projects but will have the same routing.According to DABS, the financial expenditure on the Afghan section of the project will cost an estimated $70 million USD.“We can supply extra electricity to our citizens from the sub stations which will be built in Herat, Kandahar and Helmand,” said DABS spokesman Wahidullah Waisi.Afghanistan is expected to receive $50 million USD in transit duties from the TAP project annually.This comes a week after work on the Afghanistan section of the TAPI gas pipeline project was launched in Herat province.TAPI will transport gas from Turkmenistan to Afghanistan, Pakistan and India via a 1,814-km pipeline.In Afghanistan, the TAPI pipeline will be constructed alongside the Kandahar–Herat Highway in western Afghanistan, and then via Quetta and Multan in Pakistan.The final destination of the pipeline will be the Indian town of Fazilka, near its border with Pakistan.Afghanistan is expected to earn $500 million USD in transit duties annually from the TAPI project.The pipeline will transfer 33 billion cubic meters of gas from Turkmenistan to Pakistan and India through Herat, Farah, Helmand and Nimroz provinces of Afghanistan.","['turkmenistan', 'pledges', 'tap', 'afghanistan', 'finance', 'pakistan', 'million', 'project', 'adb', 'tapi', 'power', 'cooperation', 'pipeline']",ADB Pledges To Finance TAP Project,This project will finance the construction of a gas pipeline through Turkey for transportation of natural gas from Shah Deniz production field in Azerbaijan to European and Turkish markets.,TANAP TRANS-ANATOLIAN NATURAL GAS PIPELINE

107,af79244f,EIB-20160727,1,"Share this: FacebookTwitterGoogleLinkedInRedditA European Investment Bank loan of 100 million euro to a Bulgarian agri-pharma firm was announced on January 12 after a joint session of the European Commission and the government of the country commencing its six months as holder of the rotating presidency of the EU.The EIB loan to Huvepharma is guaranteed by the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), the central pillar of the Investment Plan for Europe, known as the Juncker Plan. It represents the largest such injection of funds into Bulgaria under this plan so far.The loan agreement was signed in Sofia by European Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen, EIB Vice-President Andrew McDowell and Kiril Domuschiev, Chief Executive Officer of Biovet’s parent company Huvepharma, in the presence of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Bulgarian Prime Minister Boiko Borissov.According to the EIB, the loan will create more than 200 jobs in rural areas and strengthen the agriculture sector in Bulgaria. The loan to Huvepharma is intended to finance a boost in production levels and research and development (R&D) in the area of animal health.McDowell said: “This operation supported by the EIB and the Investment Plan for Europe will strengthen the competitiveness of a leading company in the veterinary sector in Bulgaria, reinforcing Europe’s leading position in the animal health market. This is important as animal health is a key element of the EU farming industry and an area of concern for all European citizens”.Bulgarian Agriculture Minister Roumen Porodzanov said: “I am delighted that the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union starts with such an important message to the Bulgarian agricultural sector.“The financing of this project embodies the European Investment Bank’s commitment towards the Bulgarian government and Bulgarian business. The possibility of implementing such an extremely important and effective project in the field of veterinary medicine and animal health care is indicative of the prospects for Bulgarian agriculture. We are proud that the Huvepharma project is part of the Juncker Plan,” Porodzanov said.The project covers the design, construction and management of two new facilities: a new fermentation facility for the manufacturing of active substances, nutritional supplements, enzymes, probiotics and ready medicinal formulations for animal and human health and a new plant for the manufacturing of animal vaccines.The project supports the capacity expansion of one of the few European players in the poultry and swine segment of animal health. It also supports R&D in the fields of microbiology and the development of new products, such as vaccines and enzymes, as well as process improvement and formulation, the EIB said.Both new facilities are close to the existing manufacturing sites of Biovet. The fermentation facility will be in Peshtera, a town in southern Bulgaria, 125km south-east of Sofia. The vaccine plant will be in Razgrad, a town in north-eastern Bulgaria, about 130km from Varna.The project will be implemented between 2017 and 2019 and will give a boost to local employment by creating 210 additional jobs in areas with rare qualified job opportunities, characterised by high levels of unemployment.Juncker told a joint news conference with Borissov that the Bulgarian EU Presidency was happening at a key moment for Europe and its future.He said that the Commission was to a great extent of one mind about the priorities set for the Bulgarian Presidency and the Austrian EU Presidency that will follow it.Juncker said that the EU’s future financial framework would be discussed. “In May, we will have further developments and our concern is that the work begins as soon as possible so that the previous procedure is not repeated when the Council spends too much time until it comes to an agreement, so the financial program could not be prepared within a reasonable time.”Commenting on the Western Balkans, named as priority for the Bulgarian EU Presidency, Borissov said that the most risk-free prospect for the EU is to build infrastructure in the Balkans to provide connectivity.“Not only does this not risk the EU but will allow for greater competitiveness, more tourism and the convergence of people across the Union,” Borissov said.Borissov expressed thanks for the support and everything that the EU did for Bulgaria. He added apologies to people for the disruption caused over the past two days because of stepped-up security and traffic congestion resulting from the visit by EU officials.Earlier, a government statement after face-to-face talks between Borissov and Juncker quoted the Prime Minister as saying that in Bulgaria’s 10-year membership of the EU, the country had gained experience in resolving the various crises the Union has undergone and will continue to be active in discussions about its future.“Our responsibility over the next six months is great, but we remain a reliable partner in seeking consensus on the most important topics for the community. It is very important for us to strengthen the unity of the European Union,” Borissov said.The statement said that Borissov and Juncker expressed their expectation of improved dialogue with the countries neighbouring the EU during the Bulgarian Presidency. “Your priority, Boiko – the Western Balkans, is also our priority,” Juncker was quoted as saying.Commentscomments","['eu', 'european', 'begins', 'borissov', 'euro', 'plan', 'animal', 'project', 'bulgarian', 'presidency', 'loan', 'bulgaria', 'firm', 'juncker', 'eib']",Bulgarian EU Presidency begins with EIB loan of 100M euro under Juncker Plan for agri-pharma firm,"This project finances the construction of new manufacturing facilities, and advances in Huvepharma International's research, development and innovation activities.",BIOVET PESHTERA

The project will help in increasing climate resilient practices in agriculture and ensuring that farming continues to remain a financially viable activity for them.The project is expected to benefit over 7 million people spread over an area of 3.0 million hectare and cover 5,142 villages across 15 most climate vulnerable districts of the region.The US$ 420 million loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), has a 6-year grace period, and a maturity of 24 years.The Agreements for the Maharashtra Project for Climate Resilient Agriculture were signed by Sameer Kumar Khare, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India; Bijay Kumar, Additional Chief Secretary, Agriculture Department on behalf of the Government of Maharashtra; and Junaid Ahmad,Country Director, World Bank, India on behalf of the World Bank.The Maharashtra Project for Climate Resilient Agriculture will be implemented in rural areas largely dependent upon rainfed agriculture. The project will take up a series of activities at the farm and watershed level. It will scale up climate-resilient technologies such as micro irrigation systems, expand surface water storage, and facilitate aquifer recharge, which is expected to directly contribute to a more efficient use of scarce water resources. By adopting climate-resilient seed varieties which have short maturity, are drought and heat resistant, and salt tolerant, the project will help reduce risks of climate-related crop failure, and help enhance farmer’s income.In recent years, climate variability has affected agriculture in Maharashtra, where farming is largely dominated by small and marginal farmers. Farmers have low crop productivity and a high dependence on rainfall. Severe drought in the past has affected the state’s agriculture performance. At the watershed level, project activities include building drainage lines and preparing catchment area treatment plans that promote a more efficient use of surface water for agriculture, complemented with a more sustainable use of groundwater, which will ultimately improve the availability and quality of water at the farm level.To strengthen emerging value chains for climate-resilient agricultural commodities, the project will improve the capacity of Farmer Producers Organisations to operate as sustainable, market-oriented, agri-enterprises. It will help mainstream the climate resilient agriculture agenda in various local institutions that deliver agricultural services to the farming community.India’s per capita emission of Green House Gases (GHG) is also on the rise, though current per capita levels of 2.44 tonne CO 2 equivalent in 2012, is still among the lowest in the world. In absolute terms, the agriculture sector is the second largest contributor with around 18 percent of the country’s total GHG emissions. This project will help mitigate that through carbon sequestration which involves planting trees in upper catchment areas and afforestation; growing fruit trees on small orchards; and incorporating crop residues (biomass) into the soil.Speaking on the occasion, Joint Secretary, DEA, MoF, Khare said that the Government of India accords high priority to welfare of farmers and is implementing several schemes to revitalise the agriculture sector and improve the economic condition of farmers. To cope with climate change, agricultural systems must be resilient and adapt to change. The Project will strengthen the resilience of small and marginal farmers against adverse climate events by promoting agricultural technologies and farming practices that are aimed at improving soil health, water-use efficiency and crop productivity.Emphasising the importance of the project, Junaid Ahmad said, “For India to sustain its growth across generations and become one of the world’s largest middle-class economies, the country needs to shift to a more resource-efficient growth path, which is inclusive. This project will help the rural poor, largely dependent on rain-fed agriculture, use more climate-resilient farming technologies and conserve water, a scarce resource. The project will also support the state government to shift towards a new paradigm that puts climate resilience at the core of agricultural growth and rural development in Maharashtra.","['water', 'agriculture', 'india', 'climate', '420', 'fund', 'farmers', 'bank', 'mn', 'help', 'project', 'maharashtra', 'resilient', 'world', 'farming']",World Bank to fund $ 420 mn for climate resilient farming in Maharashtra,"The project has the stated objective of enhancing ""climate-resilience and profitability of smallholder farming systems in selected districts of Maharashtra.""

132,abc93c01,IADB-BH-L1035,1,"By MORGAN ADDERLEYTribune Staff Reportermadderley@tribunemedia.netPRIME Minister Dr Hubert Minnis officially launched his Delivery Unit yesterday, a body that is meant to keep the government on track in the delivery of key promises to the electorate.Known as the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit, or PMDU, the initiative was foreshadowed in November 2017 by Press Secretary Anthony Newbold.At the time, Mr Newbold said the unit would be ""responsible for tracking projects and initiatives set out and agreed by the prime minister and establishing timelines for the completion of such projects.""It was originally supposed to be established by January 2018.In his remarks yesterday, Dr Minnis said ""deliberate and strategic steps"" must be taken to ascertain the needs of Bahamian citizens and the ""trends of key indicators"" affecting their lives.In addition to analysing these needs, a ""management mechanism"" must be created that will underscore ""accountability, transparency, and results delivery"" throughout the nation.The six key priorities the PMDU will initially focus on are the Over-the-Hill Rejuvenation Project, land reform, energy reform and infrastructure, ease of doing business, education, and safety and security.The goals of the Over-the-Hill Rejuvenation Project include community development, crime reduction, and the creation of clean environments.Other targets include reducing child abuse, school violence, youth alcoholism, and illegal gun possession.Land reform will focus on providing affordable ready-to-build housing land for citizens and executing a national land audit, which will pave the way for a land registry in the Bahamas.The government will also encourage land ownership in the Family Islands and promote the timely processing of land applications. The latter will be enabled through the provision of digital recordings of surveys and land mapping government services.The government's energy reform goals include ""creating a renewable energy economy,"" with a focus on solar energy. Meanwhile, infrastructure efforts will focus on executing a road maintenance management system and traffic management system, to provide citizens with high quality road and traffic services.Ease of doing business will focus on improving the Bahamas' global ranking on the World Bank's Doing Business Index. Increasing the speed and efficiency of government service providers that impact business operations will also be part of the process. The speed and ease with which business licence applications are processed will be increased as well. Taxation processes will also be streamlined.The education plank will address student outcomes and ""fostering a digital revolution."" One such target will be to increase the percentage of three and four-year-olds accessing preschool education from 30 per cent to 75 per cent by 2022.By that same year, the government hopes to increase the percentage of 12th graders in public schools that meet academic criteria for graduation from 51 per cent to 61 per cent. A third education target is to upgrade 100 per cent of public schools with fibre optic internet connections. This is intended to provide greater access to quality education.Safety and security initiatives will focus on crime reduction and ""ensuring that the public feels safe.""The government also hopes to ""reduce the recidivism rate of offenders,"" establish youth community centres staffed with ""qualified personnel"" and strengthen the justice system.These key priorities will be driven by data collection and analysis. As a partner in the initiative, the Inter-American Development Bank has made available the Public Financial Management - Performance Monitoring Reform Loan Facility.Through this loan, provisions have been made to ""develop a state of the art Information and communications technology system to underpin the work of the PMDU,"" officials said.Representatives from the Canadian government were also present at the launch. Canadian International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau spoke on Canada's approach to results and delivery.She suggested the government ensure the public understands the government's goals, emphasise the importance of transparency, and make sure that results are at the ""heart"" of the initiative.Dr Minnis viewed Canada's participation as an ""act of friendship and cooperation.""IDB representative Florencia Attademo-Hirt congratulated the Bahamas on ""the first Delivery Unit being set up in the Caribbean.""She also referred to the success countries such as Peru and Brazil have experienced through the establishment of their own units.When asked how the public will have access to tracking and monitoring the Delivery Unit's progress, PMDU Chief Operating Officer Viana Gardiner said this will be made available through a website that will be developed in the next few months. However, she declined to give a specific timeline.She added that members of the Delivery Unit are being recruited from both the public and private sectors.The team will have eleven members.According to Dr Minnis, the Delivery Unit will differ from other agencies in the sense that it will ""have the mandate and the authority of the prime minister to seek information from any ministry and analyse that data and to ensure that we're keeping on schedule for that timeline.""When asked if the turnaround or results in the key priorities will be seen in this tenure of the FNM, Ms Gardiner replied: ""Certainly"".","['key', 'cent', 'reform', 'meet', 'land', 'results', 'govt', 'public', 'unit', 'delivery', 'business', 'seeking', 'focus', 'promises', 'help']",Delivery Unit Seeking To Help Govt Meet Promises,,
